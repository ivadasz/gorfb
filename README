This aims to become a full blown RFB (VNC) server library written in go.

The current code design tries to avoid blocking as much as possible.
But, at the moment encoding of dirty rectangles is still serialized into
a single goroutine :(
Only raw encoding is supported so far, and no authentication mechanism is
supported.
Tracking of dirty regions uses only up to two rectangles at a time.
